Since there are many robust and capable servers for functional enrichment
analysis, we feel it is better to use a previously tool/web server than to 
try to reproduce what is already avaiable.

Examples of these services include the following:
  * [DAVID](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/)
  * [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/)
  * [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/)

For this example, we will look at how you can extract differentially 
expressed gene data for IRIS-EDA and how you can use DAVID for functional
enrichment.
